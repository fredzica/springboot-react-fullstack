# springboot-react-fullstack

A full stack application made with React and Spring Boot.

# Backend

The backend is a Spring Boot 2 application that serves a REST API. It uses JUnit 5 for unit tests. The database is an embedded H2 database. The src/main/resources/import.sql file creates its initial structure.

The api is defined in the src/main/resources/swagger.yaml file. Interfaces for the controllers are generated from the swagger definition. That code is generated by the `openApiGenerate` Gradle task.

## Dependencies

This project uses Gradle to manage its dependencies.

Java 11 is required

## Instructions to run

The project can be started by running the Gradle task `bootRun`. The variables `rsa-private-key` and `rsa-public-key` need to be informed. Since these keys are only for development purposes their disclosal poses no security threat. I commited working values in the application.properties. The application will already fetch the values automatically.


# Frontend 

The frontend is a React.js app.

## Dependencies

The dependencies are managed by NPM. Execute `npm install` in the `ui` directory to install the dependencies

## Running

The application should be run by executing `npm start` in the `ui` directory

## Additional Info

This project greatly benefited from this [React Tutorial](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2018/07/10/build-a-basic-crud-app-with-node-and-react)
